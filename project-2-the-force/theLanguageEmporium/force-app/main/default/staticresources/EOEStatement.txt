If nobody spoke a different language, there wouldn't be much need for The Language Emporium. 
As such, The Language Emporium is an Equal Opportunity Employer that celebrates everybody of different cultures,
backgrounds, races, sexualities, genders, disabilities and all the people the world has to offer in an effort 
to engage our learners with as much diversity of thought and language that the world itself provides.
